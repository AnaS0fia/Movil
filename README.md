# movies

Movies App is an application that has emerged from a test for an Android developer position. Although I finally ruled myself out for it, I want to continue developing it, so that I can practice and improve.

# install

The app uses theMoviedb.org API, you need to create and configure your own apiKey. You can create your own apiKey from here https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

After that you need to open res/values/config.xml file, and put your apiKey in "apikey" string value.

Then you can run and install the app. Enjoy it!
